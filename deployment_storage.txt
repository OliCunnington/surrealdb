-- key reason for separating storage and compute is to scale resources separately

-- benefits:
--  Less wasted capacity as scale is optimised for each workload
--  Greater cost efficiency
--  Greater flexibility
--  Better fault tolerance

-- surrealdb provides various key-value storage engines, need dependent
--  Directly in the browser
--  As a single-node server or in embedded devices
--  As a multi-node cluster in the cloud

-- also five storage engines


-- browser
--  WebAssembly
--   IndexedDB, a large-scale, NoSQL storage system
--   lives in browser in a sandboxed protected environment

-- single-node server/embedded devices
--  choose between are RocksDB (default) and SurrealKV
--  RocksDB
--    Was originally a fork of Google’s LevelDB but was then developed
--      and maintained by Meta (Facebook) entirely in C++.
--    It’s optimised for fast, low-latency storage such as flash drives
--      and high-speed disk drives using the log-structured merge-tree data structure (LSM).
--    LSM data structures are highly efficient for write-heavy workloads as they
--      minimise the number of disk writes and require less space than B-Trees, as they
--      don’t require constant reorganisation of data.
--  SurrealKV
--    SurrealKV is our own storage engine developed by us from scratch, written entirely in Rust.
--    Made to support the power and flexibility of SurrealDB, opening the door to exciting use
--      cases such as versioned queries over time, immutable data querying, historic aggregate
--      query analysis, and versioned graph queries.
--    Designed as a new data structure, an Immutable Versioned Adaptive Radix Trie (VART)
--    still in development, subject to API changes

-- multi-node cluster
-- TiKV
--  TiKV is a distributed and transactional key-value database from PingCap, built in Rust
--  It uses the Raft consensus algorithm and RocksDB (LSM) as the underlying storage engine
-- FoundationDB
--  FoundationDB is a distributed and transactional key-value database from Apple, built in C++
--  It uses the Paxos consensus algorithm and a B-tree based on SQLite as its underlying storage engine
